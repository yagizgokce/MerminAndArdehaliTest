# Mermin and Ardehali Inequalities Test

### Mermin and Ardehali Inequalities test on IBM Quantum Computer

In this study, we intend to show that quantum mechanics incompatible with the locality argument which is
proposed using the hidden variable theory by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen with quantum mechanics. Bell’s
theorem on the difference between local hidden variables and quantum mechanics is shown by Bell’s
inequalities. These inequalities say that there is a bounded correlation of distant events if assuming the
validity of locality. Mermin and Ardehali derived n-particle Bell-inequalities and we will test Mermin and
Ardehali inequalities on the IBM’s cloud computer by a constructed quantum circuit for three, four, and
five qubits.
