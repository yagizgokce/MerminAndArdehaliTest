# Mermin and Ardehali Inequalities Test

### Mermin and Ardehali Inequalities test on IBM Quantum Computer

## Abstract
In this study, we intend to show that quantum mechanics incompatible with the locality argument which is
proposed using the hidden variable theory by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen with quantum mechanics. Bell’s
theorem on the difference between local hidden variables and quantum mechanics is shown by Bell’s
inequalities. These inequalities say that there is a bounded correlation of distant events if assuming the
validity of locality. Mermin and Ardehali derived n-particle Bell-inequalities and we will test Mermin and
Ardehali inequalities on the IBM’s cloud computer by a constructed quantum circuit for three, four, and
five qubits.
